What is Dart?

Dart is an open-source, general-purpose programming language developed by Google.
It is optimized for building user interfaces and is primarily used for creating
mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.

Why is Dart Important?

1. Performance: Dart compiles to ARM and x64 machine code, providing high performance
   for mobile and desktop applications.
2. Productivity: With features like hot reload, Dart allows for quick iteration and
   development, especially when used with the Flutter framework.
3. Versatility: Dart is designed to be approachable for developers coming from various
   programming backgrounds, offering strong typing and a flexible syntax.

Use Cases of Dart:

1. Mobile Apps: Dart is the language used by the Flutter framework, which enables
   developers to create natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop
   from a single codebase.
2. Web Development: Dart can be compiled to JavaScript, making it suitable for
   building high-performance web applications.
3. Server-Side Development: Dart's robust libraries and packages support building
   server-side applications and APIs.
